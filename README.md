# Questions

1. Describe possible performance optimizations you could make to your
code itself.
- Make the layout more intuitive for the user, with dependencies to improve the layout, better structure folders and files in a way that meets the standard MVC, seek better ways to communicate with the API where the data comes from, using dependencies that can better structure the calls and being able to perform a faster response, if the response had a large mass of data, it would seek a way of processing in a queue for display on the screen, thus improving performance.

2. What could you have improved?
- More beautiful and intuitive layout, pagination in the data listing, filters to search for a specific field (userId, Id), another screen to view the request details, possibility to copy fields with just one click on the field, edit and delete any record , configuration file to have no endpoints in the code.
